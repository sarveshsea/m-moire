# Audit Frontend Design

Audit the real source tree before proposing UI changes. Memi's checks are deterministic and file-anchored; no Figma connection or background process is required.

This workflow requires a reviewed local **2.8.0-beta.2 candidate** build; beta2 is unpublished. Check `memi --version` before using these recipes. Published npm beta **2.8.0-beta.1** remains on `next`; npm stable remains **2.7.9**. Beta1’s release record is unchanged. Native Windows package-path handling and macOS arm64 JSON output remain under corrective validation; see docs/trust/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md.

## Run The Audit

From the repository root:

```bash
memi diagnose . --json --no-write --fail-on none
```

For UX behavior and visual craft detail, run only the relevant follow-up:

```bash
memi ux audit . --json --no-write
memi craft audit . --json --no-write
```

A supplied screenshot is context, not proof that Memi performed pixel analysis. Use the harness browser or image tools for actual rendered checks. Use `memi diagnose . --receipt-only --fail-on none` when the output must exclude source content.

## Workflow

1. Read repository instructions and identify the requested route or component.
2. Run `diagnose` before broad UI edits.
3. Group findings by user impact, not by checker name.
4. Verify each proposed fix against the cited file and local design tokens.
5. Implement only fixes relevant to the user's request.
6. Re-run the same command and report assessed quality, category coverage, scan omissions, and remaining findings.

## Output

Lead with actionable findings:

| Priority | Evidence | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High | `path/to/file.tsx:line` and rule id | Specific code-level fix |

Include the command run, before/after score, files changed, and unresolved risks. Never replace source evidence with generic taste advice.
