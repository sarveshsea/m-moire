# Known limitations

## Candidate status

- The public stable CLI remains 2.7.9. Trust Core 2.8 documentation describes a
  candidate contract until an exact beta artifact and evidence set are published.
- The managed Codex Deep Security Scan is pending because this host does not provide a managed filesystem permission profile.
- A beta may disclose that pending scan. Stable and employer-safe claims require
  a completed independent scan with no unresolved critical or high findings.
- `TRUST_CORE_BETA_PENDING_DESIGNWORKBENCH_EVIDENCE` means the
  `reviewed-candidate-audit` and `swiftui-rendered-rerun` receipts remain stale.
  This named exception applies only to the 2.8.0-beta.1 candidate; stable remains
  blocked until both receipts are refreshed.
- Existing 2.7.9 binaries and npm artifacts must not be described as locked by
  default merely because the 2.8 source branch adds that behavior.

## Coverage and current audit

- The historical Trust Core coverage percentage applies to four selected modules,
  not all executable source. The broader `test:core:coverage` gate measures the
  source tree and requires 80% in all four metrics before publication.
- See the [acceptance ledger](ACCEPTANCE_LEDGER.md) for the current audit,
  independent scan blocker, product findings, and remaining release evidence.

- The original frontend tarball at source `2a6d0e44` predates subsequent
  defensive runtime corrections. Its checks remain historical evidence for that
  digest and do not validate the corrected source. A new packed artifact and
  matching checks are required; see the [verification record](FRONTEND_2_8_VERIFICATION.md).
- Assessed quality and scan completeness are separate. A score of 100 does not
  certify unassessed categories, dynamic class expressions, omitted files, or
  rendered behavior. File, byte, traversal-entry, and depth limits remain bounded;
  discovery must report when those limits prevent a complete eligible scan.

## Boundary limitations

- Execution policy reduces Memi's authority; it cannot secure a compromised OS,
  runtime, package manager, browser profile, model provider, or Figma account.
- Network denial inside Memi is not a host firewall. Release E2E therefore also
  tests the artifact with networking disabled outside the process.
- Metadata-only output can still reveal counts, rule identifiers, timing, and
  hashes. Employers must decide whether that metadata is acceptable.
- Content read for a locked deterministic command exists in process memory while
  the command runs. Locked prohibits persistence and egress, not the read needed
  to perform the requested local analysis.
- Optional integrations expand the boundary and require separate dependencies,
  capabilities, destinations, credentials, and employer review.
- Node does not expose one portable directory-handle-relative file-creation API
  across the supported matrix. Receipt output therefore uses exclusive open plus
  post-open containment and file identity checks. A detected parent race can
  leave an empty file, but the writer does not send receipt bytes through that
  unvalidated handle.
- A terminated connected report writer can leave an empty `history.jsonl.lock`.
  Further history writes time out after bounded retries. Confirm no writer is
  active and inspect the lock before removing it; the engine never steals an
  unverified lock automatically.
- The legacy uninstall script is destructive and is not the Trust Core
  preserve-first uninstall path.

## Product and organization limitations

- Memi Canvas and Memi Studio remain independently gated.
- A passing CLI gate does not certify Homebrew, GHCR, MCP Registry, website,
  focused-skill, sandbox, fork, Canvas, or Studio artifacts.
- Public organization inventory cannot disclose or certify private repositories.
- Employer authorization is external evidence; Memi cannot infer it from a flag,
  repository name, email domain, or license.

Report a limitation as resolved only when the release record points to the exact
artifact and independent evidence that closes it.
